Suppression
===========
Simple plugin for Spigot / Bukkit servers. Suppression cancels the effects of players using lighters, lava buckets, and firecharges based on a permissio node.

To use:
Drop in your plugins folder, and restart / reload the server.

To permit firecharges, lighters, lava buckets:
Add "Suppression.Use" permission node to players; they will be able to use those items normally.
